I have never finished a game jam.  And I have tried.  And tried on my own
even if there was no jam.  And still, I cannot make a game.  I don't 
know why exactly.

So, I give you my attempt at doing the opposite.  I give you...

"Blurry Path", the interactive story about a kid who can't
see to save his life.

My vision: make the absolute dumbest fucking game I can.  Like,
not kinda dumb, but so dumb if you actually get to the end
I suggest therapy.  XD
